## **Inspiration üí°**

The idea for **RISUN** came from the growing need for smarter, more efficient solar grid management. As countries shift towards renewable energy, especially solar power, one of the biggest challenges is determining where to place solar panels for maximum energy generation. We wanted to create a solution that could help grid workers assess, monitor, and optimize solar installations, making solar energy more efficient and accessible to everyone.

## **What it does üåû**

**RISUN** is an AI-driven platform designed to help solar grid workers make better decisions. It uses machine learning algorithms and real-time weather data to:
- Identify optimal locations for installing solar panels.
- Detect faults in solar panels through image uploads.
- Predict solar energy production based on weather patterns.
- Provide real-time monitoring insights for solar grid performance.

In short, RISUN empowers grid operators to manage solar grids more effectively and harness solar energy to its fullest potential.

## **How we built it üõ†Ô∏è**

Building **RISUN** was a collaborative effort that involved combining different technologies:
- **Machine Learning Models**: We used **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Gradient Boost Algorithm** to detect faults in solar panels and forecast energy generation.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: We pulled in weather data from meteomatics API to help predict solar energy output and assess the best locations for solar panels.
- **Interactive Heatmaps**: Using the data we gathered, we created heatmaps that visually display the best areas for solar panel placement.
- **Web Platform**: We built an easy-to-use web interface using **MERN Stack** where grid operators can track performance, upload images for fault detection, and get insights into energy production.

## **Challenges we ran into üöß**

Like any project, **RISUN** had its challenges:
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring real-time weather data was accurate enough for reliable forecasting was a challenge.
- **Model Training**: It took time to fine-tune our machine learning models to be accurate and efficient in both fault detection and energy prediction.
- **User Experience**: Creating a simple, intuitive interface to present complex data in a way that was easy for grid operators to understand was a tricky task.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of üéâ**

We‚Äôre incredibly proud of what we accomplished with **RISUN**:
- The ability to generate **accurate energy forecasts** based on real-time data.
- Successfully **detecting faults in solar panels** from images with a high degree of accuracy.
- Building an interactive and user-friendly web platform that grid workers can use with ease.
- Creating a project that not only uses cutting-edge technology but also helps drive sustainability.

## **What we learned üìö**

Working on **RISUN** was a huge learning experience:
- We gained hands-on experience with **machine learning** and **model deployment**.
- We learned how to integrate **real-time data** into a system for practical, real-world applications.
- We got deeper insights into the challenges of **renewable energy** and how technology can help overcome them.

## **What's next for RISUN üöÄ**

The future for **RISUN** is exciting! We plan to:
- Expand the platform to include **more data sources** and improve **forecasting accuracy**.
- Introduce **mobile support** so grid workers can access RISUN on the go.
- Continue **enhancing machine learning models** for even better performance predictions and fault detection.
- Explore partnerships with **solar companies** and **energy providers** to bring RISUN to a larger audience and make a bigger impact in the world of renewable energy.
